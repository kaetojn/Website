# Code or Die

## An Educational Programming Game

Inspired by Space Invaders, this fun game aims to teach children in grades 5 and 6 some basic programming concepts. The game consists of several levels, each of increasing difficulty. Each level consists of a short lesson followed by short questions on the lesson's material, all while zombies shamble down the screen towards the player! A correct answer defeats some of the zombies, while too few correct answers allows the zombies to reach the player and hurt them!  Take too much damage and it's Game Over!



### Game Play Instructions
This game runs as a Java Application. 
* To start a level after the player is done reading a lesson, they enter: startLevel()
* To answer a question, enter: answer at question index
    * for example, to answer true for question 2, one would enter: true at 2

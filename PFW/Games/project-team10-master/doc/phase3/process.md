###Process:

Our process has not changed much from Phase 2 as it has been working well or us.  We are still having frequent meetings on Google Hangouts and in-person where necessary to make decisions on the product as a group.  Hangouts has proven to be very helpful and has cut down on the amount of in-person meetings required since we can use its voice-over-IP feature; some group members do not have microphones but can still contribute to the chat through text chat which can be read by everyone else in the group.

In addition to using Hangouts for our more formal meetings, the group is still using Facebook’s group chat feature for more impromptu and informal communication.  It is also used to coordinate meetings though with more notice beforehand than before: this has removed the need to use cell phone texting as there is plenty of time (generally 2-3 days) for people to list availabilities.

We don’t foresee having to do as much initial research on what libraries to use for this phase: we should already have most of the knowledge we require to implement the functionality for this phase.

One thing we have changed in our process is that we are going to be using issues more liberally than before, using them to set goals and keep track of our tasks: this should help us to stay on track with what’s completed and what still needs work.  While we did use issues in the previous phase, it was only towards the very end of it that we started using them in the manner Joey intended us to do.  Additionally, we are able to use them for actual issues as they pop up, not just for tasks and goals.

Start thinking about UX design for the game: Everyone


###Rationale:

We have distributed the tasks for this phase based on a volunteer basis as well as work done in the previous phase. Group members who have been working on one particular aspect of the game, such as questions implementation, will continue to work on that aspect or a closely related aspect. The design of the user interface will incorporate ideas from all members.

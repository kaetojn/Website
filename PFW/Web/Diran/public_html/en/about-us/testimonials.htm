	<h1>Testimonials</h1>
    <p><em>Does your real estate agent truly have what it takes to ensure you get the most out of your biggest investment?
</em></p>
   
	<h2>A little extra goes a long way!</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Brent, Thanks so much for all the extra time you took to investigate mortgage options for me. Thanks to Audrey as well!</p>
		<p><em>Marina</em></p>
	</blockquote>

    <h2>Goodbye worries!</h2>
	<blockquote>
	  <p>We just wanted to thank you for the outstanding service you provided for the sale of our house. Your efforts helped us sell our house for the best possible price and in a short period of time. We couldn't have done it without your help!</p>
		<p>One of the determining factors in selecting you as our agent was the fact that you include free staging services. We did not realize the time and commitment required to stage a house. Your staging crew took the time and made the effort necessary (two to three full days) to transform our lived-in home into a beautiful showpiece. The transformation was so incredible that we even reconsidered moving!</p>
		<p>In addition to the complimentary staging services, you also provided the ultimate in outstanding customer service. Just hours after we confirmed our intentions to retain you as our realtor, your design team was at our home (free of charge) to evaluate the changes necessary to maximize the sale price of our house. You also took the time to coordinate all the services we required (i.e. painting, window washing and house cleaning services), and even personally helped us sweep the backyard deck before the photographer took pictures! The photographs and colour brochures were amazing!</p>
		<p>Your customer service is truly exceptional. You always took the time to answer our questions and provide information and feedback to us. In addition, you always responded immediately (literally within minutes) when we called or emailed you. We are certain that we would not have received this outstanding level of customer service elsewhere.</p>
		<p>Without reservation, we would definitely recommend you as a realtor to our friends and family. Your knowledge, dedication and commitment to providing superior customer service goes well above and beyond what is required.</p>
        <p><em>Laurie & Pavel on their selling experience with Brent</em></p>

	<h2>Driven by passion</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Audrey, thank you for being the full package - being available, knowing the market, knowing the neighbourhood, knowing the potential buyer, maximizing staging so that prospective buyers can see the home for all that it can be, honest and open discussions, efficiency from start to finish, and most of all, for the passion that drives it all. It isn't about the commission, it's about optimizing the value of your home, which is what you deliver. When the time comes for my next sale, I will only be making one phone call.</p>
		<p><em>Debbie</em></p>
	</blockquote>

	<hr />

	<h2>Better than a crystal ball!</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Audrey, <br />Throughout the entire process of buying and selling our home, you told us that you didn't have a crystal ball to predict the outcome. As it turns out, you have something better: experience. That, combined with your integrity and impressive interpersonal skills, makes for the type of agent we'll continually recommend. You are that good.  </p>
		<p>We knew within 20 minutes of meeting you that we would choose you to sell our place as opposed to the other agent ‒ a very difficult decision based on the circumstances.  We can confidently say that we haven't regretted that decision one bit - you went above and beyond the expectations of any other real estate agent.   
</p>
		<p>As busy as you are, you never rushed us. You continued to give us excellent advice even after our home was sold. Furthermore, the people you choose to work with are spectacular.</p>
		<p>Thank you for helping make an otherwise stressful experience, a more enjoyable one.</p>
		<p>Happily ever after,<br /><em>Tali, Gavin & Chloe :)</em></p>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>A special brand of magic.</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Dear Brent,<br />
I just wanted to say thank you once again for all your work in getting my house on Malvern sold. It was all done so quickly and painlessly that I still can't believe it! You really worked magic to get it done. And I also greatly appreciate the interest you took in the house that I bought. Now that's dedication - when you drive halfway across town to look at the house I was buying through another agent. Your support and professional opinion meant a lot to me. I will invite you and Audrey over for a cup of tea (depending on your preference) once I settle into the new place. It only took me only a couple of days to get ensconced in its cozy and charming rooms.</p>
		<p> I knew that if you had not responded so quickly when I first called you and given me a good assessment of the selling price for Malvern, I would not have had the confidence to put in the offer needed to get the house on Brentwood. I will forever be grateful for all of your assistance in both transactions.
</p>
		<p>All the best,<br /><em>Krista</em></p>

	<h2>Tricking the trickster!</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Audrey is so good at what she does that you may be tempted to believe she's sold her soul to the devil in exchange for extraordinary real estate skills.</p>
		<p>However, the truth is far more sinister - it was the devil who sold his soul to Audrey and she managed to secure it for $100,000 under the original asking price!</p>
		<p><em>Ross</em></p>
	</blockquote>

	<hr />
	
	<h2>Marketing strategies that pay off</h2>
	<blockquote>		
		<p>Now that the dust has settled after graduation from Audrey's Boot Camp, we wanted to let you know how pleased we are with the end result.</p>
		<p>Your name came to us highly recommended and we knew we had choices. You came in prepared and confident. You set the bar high and stood out from the rest. When the finishing touches were put on the house and the "For Sale" sign went up, we knew the seeds had been planted and were about to sprout. Based on the amount of traffic we saw even before the weekend open house, your marketing strategy clearly paid off.  All along we were able to smile, knowing that we were in good hands. Your work behind the scenes clearly paid off and we sold well over asking price.</p>
		<p>We would not hesitate to recommend you to any friends or family who ask us for suggestions. We can confidently say that Audrey delivers.</p>
		<p>Thank you again.<br /><em>Cal and Sandra</em></p>

	<h2>Buying or selling?  Call Audrey!</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Audrey is just amazing and I would recommend her without hesitation to anyone buying and selling a home. Although she brings an incredible amount of expertise to the relationship, let me focus on the three areas that were really important to us.</p>
		<h3>Negotiation</h3>
		<p>At the end of the day, buying and selling a house is about getting a great price for the home you buy and maximizing the sale price on the one you are leaving. Audrey has exceptional negotiation skills and her pulse on the market. She has specific strategies on both sides and is an incredible negotiator. Her market expertise, her great relationships with other agents and her inside track on the industry are priceless and worth every penny of her commission. In our case, she was able to negotiate $100,000 below the original asking price of the home we bought (in a high demand area – the Beaches – and in a hot market where bidding wars are the norm). When we sold our house, her recommendations to stage and her marketing were stellar. We were able to get $75,000 over asking and the highest selling price for a semi to date in our neighbourhood. Her open house generated nearly 100 visits on top of the over 50 showings during the week. There were many offers on offer day. While we had a solid house to sell in a good neighbourhood (Leslieville), that level of activity is only generated with a great agent working on your behalf.</p>
		<h3>Communication</h3>
		<p>Audrey provides great service and communication. She responds instantly to any questions and requests, and is always available to show you any home.  She also has great perspective and can give you an unbiased, unemotional view of the home you're looking to buy and the home you're looking to sell.  She sees both the benefits and shortcomings that you may overlook in this highly emotional process. With Audrey, I always felt supported throughout the process and that she was constantly working on our behalf. You couldn't expect more in terms of service and communication.
</p>
		<h3>Staging</h3>
		<p>Audrey's services include professional staging, which will blow your mind. We are very house proud and have invested substantially into both the structure and design of our home. When Audrey recommended doing some additional work that amounted to a $10,000 investment (painting, carpets, etc.), I was initially skeptical and nervous as we had just put the majority of our savings on the down payment for the home we had bought and were very tight financially.  
</p>
		<p>All I can say is WOW. If Audrey recommends that you do something, just close your eyes and take the plunge – it will make the difference in the sale price of your home, and you won't regret it.  She has done this a hundred times over and has the expertise, experience and perspective to guide you in the right direction. If she advises you to spend some money doing something to stage the house better – just do it. Audrey works hard and is really, really good. I was so impressed with Audrey that, even though she was both our buying agent and selling agent, I did not even try to negotiate down her 5% commission on the sale of our house. I really do believe that she is worth every penny she earns. </p>
		<p><em>Karla</em></p>
